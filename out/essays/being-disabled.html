<h1 id="beingdisabled">Being Disabled</h1>

<p>In early 2008, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. I became very sick
and spent a week in the hospital, three days in the ICU. When I emerged
a week later I was feeling good, had been educated on how to take care
of my health, and was now affected by a “lifelong chronic disease”, in
the words of the National Institutes of Health<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>The thing is, I don’t <em>feel</em> disabled. My diabetes is not a burden.
Diabetes doesn’t pose a long-term health risk if I manage it, it doesn’t
keep me from doing what I want to do, and it certainly hasn’t kept me
from being a normal American teenager. Synonyms of the word “chronic”
include “ceaseless”, “unabating”, “dire”, but none of these terms
describe my life. So I’m left wondering: <em>Am I disabled? Is this even an
illness? Am I missing something?</em></p>

<p>To be technical, here’s how diabetes affects my life: my body does not
make insulin, a hormone that controls glucose levels in the blood; I
have to manually inject insulin into my bloodstream. A type 1 diabetic’s
job is to be a Goldilocks with their insulin levels: make sure you don’t
get too much insulin, or too little—just the right amount to normalize
your blood sugar.</p>

<p>I wear a device called an <em>insulin pump</em> which constantly supplies a
little insulin to my body through a small catheter. The pump contains a
vial of insulin, and by manipulating its settings I’m able to
micromanage how much insulin I’m getting at a given moment. I have no
dietary restrictions–I just have to dial into my pump whatever it is I’m
eating so I can get the insulin to compensate. Aside from that, I keep
another device called a <em>glucose meter</em> around so I check the glucose
levels in my blood, and I need some sort of food with me, in case my
blood sugar gets too low and I need to spike it back up. As someone
who’s used this regimen daily for the past 6 years, this routine is
relatively simple, and all second-nature.</p>

<p>Yet I’m disabled. Ironically, the time my diabetes felt most like a
disability was in the process of receiving accommodations from my
university. I remember the administrative coordinator acting
uncomfortable even throwing around the name of my diagnosis. It bothered
me that my “condition” was deemed too impolite to say out loud.</p>

<p>Additionally, while researching I stumbled upon the legal ADA definition
of a disability, which reads “a physical or mental impairment that
substantially limits one or more major life activities”<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a>. I
immediately thought, <em>Oh I’m sure I don’t qualify for that</em>, then
noticed that “diabetes” was an example impairment in the document, and
that type 1 diabetics fall under the law’s “umbrella of protection”<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a>.
I stand corrected.</p>

<p>I want my experience to be taken as it is; not overemphasized out of a
desire to set me apart or to be politically correct. Even people whom
society labels as more “chronically disabled” than I agree: dwarf actor
Warwick Davis remarked, “The world worries about disability more than
disabled people do.”<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> I agree. This is my disease, but it is not my life.</p>
